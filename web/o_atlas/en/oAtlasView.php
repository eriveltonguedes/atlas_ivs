        The <b>Atlas of Human Development in Brazil 2013</b> includes the Atlas
        of Human Development of Municipalities and the Atlas of Human Development 
        of Metropolitan Areas, and is a consultation platform for the Municipal Human 
        Development Index – MHDI – of the 5,565 Brazilian municipalities, 27 states (FU), 
        16 metropolitan areas (MA) and their human development units (HDU). The Atlas 
        shows, beyond the MHDI, more than 200 of demographics, education, income, 
        employment, housing and vulnerability, with data extracted from the Demographic 
        Censuses of 1991, 2000 and 2010.

        Designed as a simple and user-friendly tool, the Atlas Brazil 2013 facilitates access to 
        information and the use of data, encouraging further analyses. This tool provides 
        an overview of the human development and the inequality inside municipalities, 
        states and metropolitan areas It is relevant through its ability to provide information 
        about the political unit closest to the daily lives of citizens – the municipality. In turn , 
        the Atlas of the Metropolitan Areas allows to know the inequalities at intramunicipal levels, 
        comparing "neighborhoods" of the same metropolitan area.

        The municipalities and Metropolitan Areas of Brazil are important parts of a
        complex mosaic and face numerous challenges, but also tremendous opportunities. 
        There are over 5000 territories ripe with creativity and experience and searching 
        for innovative local development solutions. By providing a closer look at the 
        municipalities, states and metropolitan areas, the Atlas Brazil 2013 leads the way 
        and allows us to reflect upon the course of human development in the country.
